### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model
developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a
second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where
pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision
and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time
resources required to develop neural network models on these
problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related
problems. We have used Resnet-50, VGG-16 & Inception V3 model to train our models.
